32pixels is a one-man software design studio created by myself, [John W. Long](http://johnwlong.com).

I enjoy building web applications.

Previously, I built [Radiant CMS](https://github.com/radiant/radiant) and [Serve](https://github.com/jlong/serve). I was also the managing editor for [_The Sass Way_](https://github.com/thesassway/thesassway.com).

I'm currently employed by [Elastic Path](https://elasticpath.com) as a Product Manager on [CX Studio](https://unstack.com) &mdash; a Content Management System made for composable commerce.

32pixels is my side business. While I sometimes take on design projects for other people, I mostly focus on my own projects like [Zest Icons](https://zesticons.com) in my spare time.
